# National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data acquisition

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) is a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiative that provides high-resolution aerial imagery of the continental United States. Captured during the agricultural growing seasons, NAIP imagery has a spatial resolution of 1 meter and typically includes Red, Green, Blue (RGB), and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands. The imagery recently published have spatial resolution of 0.6 meter. The imagery is orthorectified and projected in UTM coordinates, making it suitable for precise spatial analysis. 

NAIP data is publicly available and commonly used for land cover classification, vegetation monitoring, wetland mapping, and urban development assessment. Each U.S. state is generally imaged every 2â€“3 years, depending on funding and program priorities. 

The most recent NAIP collected by Virginia in 2021 can be access: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/69003, the 2018 Virginia NAIP can be access: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/58386.
